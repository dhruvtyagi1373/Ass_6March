Using this approach, we conclude that the average customer satisfaction is neutral (3), assuming an equal interval between each category.\n",

    "In statistics, there are several common measures of central tendency and variability used to describe a dataset. These measures provide valuable insights into the typical or average value of the data and how spread out or clustered the values are. Let's explore each measure and its role in describing a dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: The mean is the most widely used measure of central tendency. It is calculated by summing all the values in the dataset and dividing the sum by the total number of values. The mean represents the average value of the data and provides a measure of the center. It is sensitive to extreme values and can be affected by outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median: The median is the middle value in a dataset when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order. If the dataset has an odd number of values, the median is the middle value. If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values. The median is a robust measure that is less influenced by extreme values and outliers compared to the mean. It represents the value that splits the dataset into two equal halves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode: The mode is the value or values that occur most frequently in a dataset. It represents the most common or dominant value(s) in the dataset. Unlike the mean and median, the mode can be used for both numerical and categorical data. In some cases, a dataset may have multiple modes or no mode at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Variability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Range: The range is the simplest measure of variability and is calculated by taking the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. It provides a measure of the spread between the extreme values. However, the range is highly influenced by outliers and does not provide information about the distribution of values within the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance: Variance measures the average squared deviation of each value from the mean. It quantifies the spread or dispersion of the data. A higher variance indicates greater variability, while a lower variance indicates less variability. However, the variance is not on the same scale as the original data, making it less interpretable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It is widely used because it is on the same scale as the original data and provides a measure of spread that is easier to interpret. A higher standard deviation indicates greater variability, while a lower standard deviation indicates less variability. Like variance, the standard deviation is influenced by outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interquartile Range (IQR): The IQR is the range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3) of a dataset. It represents the spread of the middle 50% of the data. The IQR is robust against outliers and provides a measure of variability that is less affected by extreme values."
